I wanted the questions organized by chapters ... but the test creation
tool I wanted to be able to pick and choose questions.  For example I
may have 6 questions about MMUs, but may want to pick only 2 for a
given test.  So I was expecting this this tool to be an interactive one.
That is why I was somewhat expecting it to be part of a test question
pool editor and "database" and then a test creation part of the GUI.

Here is my tree I currently have:

   .../Class
         /number  (like 447)
            /QTR   (like w21 or f20 or s18 ... or even now sm21)
               /grades  (where I keep my grades and when doing it by
                         hand, my test scans and grading of them.)
               /plan  (where I had my tests, syllabus and assignments)
               /lec   (lecture slides)
               (and other ones for classes.)

So, if I was going to have a test question bank it might be:
       .../Class/447/test-db

And then I'd want the tests to  be written to the ../Class/447/qtr/plan
directory .. which might be doable by running it in that directory.
